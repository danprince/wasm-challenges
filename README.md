# WebAssembly Challenges
Tiny programming challenges designed as exercises for learning WebAssembly through writing your own [`.wat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) files.

Requires [`node`](https://nodejs.org) and [`wabt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt).

Run `./tests.mjs` to compile the text format files to WebAssembly and run the tests.
